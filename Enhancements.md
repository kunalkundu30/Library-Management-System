 Enhancements for Library Management System

The current implementation of the Library Management System (LMS) serves as a robust foundation for managing library operations. However, with additional time and resources, several enhancements could be implemented to improve performance, scalability, and usability. Here are some proposed enhancements:

## 1. Enhanced Data Management
- **Current Approach**: The system currently relies on CSV files for all data operations, including storage and real-time operations.
- **Enhancement**: Transition to using CSV files strictly for persistent storage, while employing in-memory data structures (like dictionaries) for runtime operations. This would significantly reduce file I/O operations, improving performance.
- **Benefits**: Increased efficiency and speed, especially for search, update, and delete operations.

## 2. Use of `kwargs` for Flexible Parameter Handling
- **Current Approach**: Functions and methods with multiple parameters can become difficult to manage and extend.
- **Enhancement**: Implement the use of `**kwargs` in functions and methods that require a large number of parameters. This would allow for more flexible data passing and easier function updates.
- **Benefits**: Simplified function signatures, improved code readability, and easier incorporation of new parameters without modifying existing function calls.

## Conclusion
These enhancements are aimed at making the Library Management System more efficient, scalable, and user-friendly. While the current system provides a solid foundation, these improvements could significantly enhance its capabilities and user experience.
